# Context free grammar
* CFG is a computation model that can do more things than finite automaton.

# Terminology of context free grammar
A context free grammar is a 4-tuple $\left(V,\Sigma,R,S\right)$

|Notation|Example|Meaning|
|--------|-------|-------|
|$()\rightarrow()$|$A\rightarrow 0A1$|Production: (substitution) rule used in CFG|
|symbol|$A$|Variable: symbols at the left side of a substitution rule|
|symbol|$0,1$|Terminal: symbols that <u>only</u> exist at the right side of a substitution rule; empty string $\varepsilon$ is not considered a symbol as it is a string.; $A$ appears on the left hand side as well, so it is not a terminal.|
|$S$|$S$|Starting variable: Top left symbol among substitution rules|
|$L(G)$|$\lbrace \emptyset,01,0011,000111...\rbrace$|set of every string that can be generated by substitution rules|
|$V$|$\lbrace A,S\rbrace$|Variables|
|$\Sigma$|$\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$|Terminals|
|$R$|$\lbrace S\rightarrow 0S1, S\rightarrow R, R\rightarrow \varepsilon \rbrace$|(substitution) rules|
|$\Rightarrow$|$u\Rightarrow v$|Yield: we can go from $u$ to $v$ in a substitution|
|$\stackrel{\star}{\Rightarrow}$|$u\stackrel{\star}{\Rightarrow}v$|Yield: we can go from $u$ to $v$ in multiple substitutions; it is the same as $u\Rightarrow v_{1}\Rightarrow v_{2}\Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow v$|
|$()\Rightarrow () \Rightarrow()$|$u\Rightarrow v_{1}\Rightarrow v_{2}\Rightarrow v$|Derivation; we call the example, derivation of $v$ from $u$|


# Creating string from context free grammar
1. write down starting variable
1. replace all the variables using substitution rules until only terminal remains
1. what is remaining is the generated string

# Context free language(CFL)
* A set of strings created from some context free grammar is called context free language.
* $A=L(G)$ for some CFG $G$
* There should be only variables at the left hand side of substitution rule, in the context free grammar.
    * $B\rightarrow1A$ is a valid substitution rule for context free grammar.
    * $B1\rightarrow 1A$ is not a valid substitution rule for context free grammar, because there is 1 on the LHS of the substitution rule.

# Parse tree
* graphical representation of the derivation of a string
* it is a tree structure whose root node is the starting variable

# Ambiguity
* If a string that can be interpreted with more than one parse tree is ambiguous.
* Example
    * Given $E\rightarrow E+E | E\times E | (E) | a$
    * String $a+a\times a$ can be derived in multiple ways
    * Therefore, the string is ambiguous.
